          Hi, and welcome to my website! I am a junior studying data science at
          the University of Utah.

          I scraped several hundred gigabytes of social media posts and analyzed
          the music found in them. Videos were scraped from the Telegram social
          media platform. Music metadata was retrieved from the videos using
          Shazam. <br /><br />
          Videos were retrieved over the course of months. The scraping process
          was scheduled using SystemD units on a linux server. CSV metrics on
          the data were updated asyncronously via file changes. The code for the
          scraper and data processing was written in Python.

          I used PyMol to create an animation of a binder enzyme as it
          transitions to the bound state. The program 'Climber' is used to
          interpolate between the bound and apo states. The rendered video can
          be found

          I trained a adversarial autoencoder on ASCII art. The characters in
          the art are represented as one hot encoded vectors at each 'pixel' in
          the string. <br />

          A simple native GUI written in Rust for the ethminer CLI program. It
          includes capturing of console output from the program, and asyncronous
          channel communication using Tokio.
