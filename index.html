            A D3 javascript web app which uses a physics simulation to display
            the percent change in value of various stocks from the S&P 500. This
            project was made for Vis for Data Science 2022 taught by Dr.
            Alexander Lex at the University of Utah. Source code to be added
            soon!

            I scraped several hundred gigabytes of social media posts and
            analyzed the music found in them. Videos were scraped from the
            Telegram social media platform. Music metadata was retrieved from
            the videos using Shazam. <br /><br />
            Videos were retrieved over the course of months. The scraping
            process was scheduled using SystemD units on a linux server. CSV
            metrics on the data were updated asyncronously via file changes. The
            code for the scraper and data processing was written in Python.

            I used PyMol to create an animation of a binder enzyme as it
            transitions to the bound state. The program 'Climber' is used to
            interpolate between the bound and apo states.

            I trained a variational quantized autoencoder on ASCII art. The
            characters in the art are represented as one hot encoded vectors at
            each 'pixel' in the string. The discrete latents learned by this
            model were used to train a bidirectional transformer. The
            transformer was trained to predict masked latent tokens, akin to
            <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.04200.pdf">MaskGit</a> by Google
            research.

                    This video shows the interpolation of the latent space of
                    the VQ VAE. In the top left corner you can see a
                    visualization of the discrete tokens which compose the
                    latent space. The left ascii art is the decoded
                    representation of the current embedding. On the right is the
                    unaltered ascii art that is being interpolated to.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    First, a new datapoint is randomly pulled from the set of
                    training items. This is shown as the ascii art on the right
                    side. Interpolation is done over spacial dimensions,
                    truncating or padding with zeros the interpolated-from and
                    interpolated-to embedding tensors and linearly combining
                    them based on the current step in the interpolation. You can
                    observe the dimensions of the embedding space shift with
                    this interpolation.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Next, the masking step can be observed. Randomly, tokens in
                    the top right are masked and turn red. The bidirectional
                    transformer then in one pass reconstructs the set of tokens.
                    The reconstructed tokens and decoded ascii art are then
                    shown for about a second before again starting interpolation
                    to the next data point.
