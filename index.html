            A D3 javascript web app which uses a physics simulation to display
            the percent change in value of various stocks from the S&P 500. This
            project was made for Vis for Data Science 2022 taught by Dr.
            Alexander Lex at the University of Utah. Source code to be added
            soon!

            I scraped several hundred gigabytes of social media posts and
            analyzed the music found in them. Videos were scraped from the
            Telegram social media platform. Music metadata was retrieved from
            the videos using Shazam. <br /><br />
            Videos were retrieved over the course of months. The scraping
            process was scheduled using SystemD units on a linux server. CSV
            metrics on the data were updated asyncronously via file changes. The
            code for the scraper and data processing was written in Python.

            I used PyMol to create an animation of a binder enzyme as it
            transitions to the bound state. The program 'Climber' is used to
            interpolate between the bound and apo states.

            I trained a adversarial autoencoder on ASCII art. The characters in
            the art are represented as one hot encoded vectors at each 'pixel'
            in the string.

            A simple cross platform GUI app written in Rust for the ethminer CLI
            program. It includes capturing of console output from the program,
            and asyncronous channel communication using Tokio.
