							Evaluating the logical thinking from llms:
						</div>

						Humans have written a trove of step-by-step explanations and proofs.
						These exist on the internet, and some of them end up in the
						pre-training data for large language models. Thus, some modicum of
						step-by-stepedness exists in the weights of LLMs.

						<br />
						<br />

						Say we want an LLM to give an answer to a multiple choice question.

						<div class="video-container">
							<div class="video-box">
								<pre>
Human: Question: 30% of all Huhulians own
at least one TV. 24% of Huhulians who own
at least one TV own at least four TV's. What
percent of Huhulians own at least four TV's?

Choices:
(A): .084%
(B): 24%
(C): 4.67%
(D): 7.2%
(E): 15.6%
		      </pre
								>
							</div>
						</div>

						Instead of simply asking directly for the answer, we can coerce the
						model into producing a step-by-step explaination.

						<div class="video-container">
							<div class="video-box">
								<pre>
Assistant: Let's think step by step: 30% of
Huhulians own at least one TV. Of those 30%,
24% own at least four TVs. So 24% of 30%, or
0.24 x 0.3 = 0.072 = 7.2% of Huhulians own at
least four TVs. The correct answer is choice (D).

Human: Given all of the above, what's the
single, most likely answer?
Assistant: The single, most likely answer is (
D)

						Prompting in this way generally leads to better scores on benchmark
						tasks. The reason why such explanations lead to better performance
						is addressed by the paper
						<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13702"
							>Measuring Faithfulness in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning</a
						>.
						<br />

						The authors demonstrate that the information in the step-by-step
						thinking is important for the LLM to produce the correct answer.
						They use another LLM to corrupt the text in the reasoning by adding
						mistakes. This corruption changes the final answer the LLM predicts,
						which is good because we want to make sure that the model's answer
						depends on the reasoning. If there are mistakes in the reasoning we
						expect that the final answer to be incorrect because it is based off
						of incorrect logic.

						<br />
						<br />

						A model can produce incorrect reasoning but still come up with a
						correct answer. This is called post-hoc reasoning. Even though the
						answer is correct we don't want the model using post-hoc reasoning.
						Explanations should be useful to helping us understand why a certain
						conclusion is reached. If the model is unable to explain in simple
						terms why a certain answer is correct, how should we be expected to
						trust the final conclusion? As Richard Feynman was once quoted: "If
						you can't explain something in simple terms, you don't understand
						it"

						<br />
						<br />

						The authors estimate the amount of post-hoc reasoning by measuring
						the chance that the LLM changes it's answer given the corrupted
						prompt. For some benchmark tasks, they measure a significant amount
						of post-hoc reasoning. Across all benchmarks, adding mistakes to the
						reasoning causes a decrease in post-hoc reasoning. At first this
						made me do a double take. Why would mistakes decrease post-hoc
						reasoning? Or in other words, why would mistakes increase the
						model's faithfulness to the step-by-step reasoning?

						<br />
						<br />

						One explanation is that a mistake presents suprising information
						which causes the model to pay greater attention to the reasoning.
						Inversely you could say that the reasoning going as expected can
						cause the model not to rely on it. But how can we cause models to be
						more faithful to the reasoning when the reasoning is correct?

						<br />
						<br />

						The authors discuss some interesting ideas to address this. One way
						to ensure that the answer 100% depends on the reasoning is to get
						the model to produce a logical program which when run will output
						the answer. You can do this by getting the model to generate python
						code. But this would be difficult to use for many natural language
						tasks.

						<br />
						<br />

						Another method is to decompose a question into sub questions, which
						are then explained and answered in turn.

						<br />
						<br />

						Given how difficult it is to measure adherance to reasoning, the
						authors' derived metric does well at capturing how faithful an
						explaination is. But underlying all of this is the idea that there
						exists some overall ground truth reasoning that can logical explain
						every single problem. As Spock learned in the original Star Trek,
						cold reasoning can't be applied to everything.
