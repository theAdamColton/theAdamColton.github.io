	Serbia is located to the west of Romania. The large Romanian city Timisoara is
	located quite close to the Serbian border. Despite the proximity, it is not
	simple for travellers to book transportation into Serbia.

	It seems like it would be easy to travel from Timisoara to Serbia, but it isn't
</MediaBox>

<p>
	There are no international trains. There are buses but they are expensive.
	There are seats on passenger vans which apparantly cost 25 euros and require
	private booking through telegram. There is an alternative and it is to walk
	through the countryside for 15km.

	You will be walking from the border crossing at Moravica to the medium sized
	Serbian town Вршац (pronounced Vershatz). Moravica is reachable by train from
	Timisoara with several running each day. The train is a decrepid single car
	and travels at about 30mph. The rail staff in Romania all have fantastic
	mustaches. To impress them grow a mustache of your own. The overall route is
	not infrequent for the intrepid and you may encounter some fellow travellers.
	No Romanian in their right mind crosses the border this way.

<p>
	The crossing process starts right as you disembark at Moravita. The border man
	will question you briefly before taking you up to the checkpoint by van. The
	checkpoint is located on the highway. You will cross both the Romanian and
	Serbian checkpoints on foot but they will stamp your passport with a marking
	with a car symbol. Make sure to not have any bad drugs on you. This is for not
	only for your safe passage but also for the health and safety of the Serbian
	border guards who will open each of the pill capsules they find and test for
	illicit odors with a brusque sniffing.

<p>
	After a brief fondling you will be let loose on the Serbian highway. It is not
	a miserable walk to Вршац. Hitchhiking is not illegal and is not looked down
	on. You may find a well intentioned driver to offer you a ride. You do not
	need to stick out your thumb but you can. Prepare your backpack in advance for
	hitchiking. Put your valuables in a small bag that you can keep on your lap
	and then your other more superfluous belongings in a bag you can throw
	haphazardly into the trunk. Drivers in Serbian cities are generally very
	careful but the blue collar drivers have frightening tendencies. Items in your
	throw bag may or may not get crushed or wet.

<p>
	With the language barrier you may find yourself being dropped off in some city
	on the outskirts of Belgrade. Inter city train schedules are intermittent and
	confusing . I'd recommend walking and there are abundant country walking paths
	to convey you to Belgrade.

	There is a pleasant 20km trail from Panchevo to Belgrade.
